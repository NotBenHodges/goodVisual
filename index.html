    <h1>Good Data Visualization</h1>
    <p>Here is an interesting Game of Thrones visualization</p>
    <p><a href="http://beta.wind-and-words.com/">Wind and Words</a></p>
    <p>Wind and Words is a good visualization in that it follows Cairo's <br>
      principles of balancing beauty with good data. It collects the number <br>
      of lines of one character addressing another and then draws lines <br>
      between them so that the many relationships in the show are easily <br>
      outlined. The site looks good without sacrificing the purpose of the <br>
      data collected. The lines between characters are recognizable and easy <br>
      to follow and the specific number of lines appears next to the character's <br>
      image. Each season is a separate category so that the number of characters <br>
      that come and go are not collected together.</p>
