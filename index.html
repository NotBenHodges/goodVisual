    <h1>Good Data Visualization</h1>
    <p>Here is an interesting Game of Thrones visualization</p>
    <p><a href="http://beta.wind-and-words.com/">Wind and Words</a></p>
    <p>Wind and Words is a good visualization in that it follows Cairo's <br>
      principles of balancing beauty with good data. It collects the number
      of lines of one character addressing another and then draws lines
      between them so that the many relationships in the show are easily
      outlined. The site looks good without sacrificing the purpose of the
      data collected. The lines between characters are recognizable and easy
      to follow and the specific number of lines appears next to the character's
      image. Each season is a separate category so that the number of characters
      that come and go are not collected together.</p>
