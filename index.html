    <h1>Good Data Visualization</h1>
    <p>Here is an interesting Game of Thrones visualization</p>
    <p><a href="http://beta.wind-and-words.com/">Wind and Words</a></p>
    <p>Wind and Words is a good visualization in that it follows Cairo's <br>
      principles of balancing beauty with good data. It collects the number <br>
      of lines of one character addressing another and then draws lines <br>
      between them so that the many relationships in the show are easily <br>
      outlined. The site looks good without sacrificing the purpose of the <br>
      data collected. The lines between characters are recognizable and easy <br>
      to follow and the specific number of lines appears next to the character's <br>
      image. Each season is a separate category so that the number of characters <br>
      that come and go are not collected together.</p>
    <h1>Bad Data Visualization</h1>
    <p>Here is a visualization not as good.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonoberholtzer/2012/07/03/today-in-
      horrible-infographics-attack-of-the-debt-monkey/#6b6ef291b36b">
    Attack of the Debt Monkey</a></p>
    <p>Attack of the debt monkey is a bad data visualization according to the
      standards of Cairo. Cairo frequently emphasizes the need for visuals that
      are truthful before anything else. This includes unique aesthetic choices.
      The graph that features a monkey on a ranger's back does very little to
      effectively communicate any meaningful data. We have no hard representation
      of the data in this image which makes it hard to read despite the unique
      design.</p>
